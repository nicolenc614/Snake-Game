# Snake-Game
CSC 4999 Project : Sanke Game 2.0

This project is about recreating the solution to the classic snake game using x86 assembly language with Kip Irvine libraries.
This snake game is however different from the classic snake game due to its multi-features such as having multiple speed levels and obstacle levels .
